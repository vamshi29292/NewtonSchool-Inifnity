//js is execution is run in two phases.
// 1. Creation Phase and 2. Execution Phase.
// Creation Phase - Is run each time on a function invocation and creates an execution context for the function.
// Execution Phase - Runs after creation phase and until the end of the function.

// ExecutionContext - Simply put, an execution context is an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, itâ€™s run inside an execution context.

// Global execution context created at the beginning of the script.
